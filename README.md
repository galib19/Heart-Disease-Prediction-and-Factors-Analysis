# CSE-841-Project

This project aims at predicting heart disease effectively with consideration of performance measures
and significant factors/attributes analysis. So, it addresses two aspects: how well can we predict heart
disease and how the factors influence heart disease prediction. Several machine learning models and data
mining techniques will be employed here for prediction and feature analysis. UCI repository: Cleveland
database will be used here.
