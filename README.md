# Heart Disease Prediction and Factors Analysis

This project aims at predicting heart disease effectively with consideration of performance measures
and significant factors/attributes analysis. So, it addresses two aspects: how the factors influence
heart disease prediction and how well we can predict heart disease. By doing so, heart disease can
be analyzed and predicted more effectively.

Several machine learning techniques with various configurations are employed here for prediction
and important factors analysis. UCI repository: Cleveland database is used here for evaluation.
Finally, this study suggests an analysis of important factors and recommend machine learning
techniques to effectively predict heart disease.
